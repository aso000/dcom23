# How Machine Models Learn

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

In this exercise you will understand what is supervised machine learning and how machine learning models are trained using a Jupyter Notebook:
•	Prepare a dataset for training (Training, validation, and test data)
•	Visualize the optimization process for backpropagation, observing the loss on training and validation data 
•	Perform inference on unseen (test) data

## 🧠 Theory

Machine learning can be an appropriate response to diverse classes of problems where writing rules can be tedious, error-prone, and ineffective. The following slides bring some fundamentals about that:   
•	What Problems does AI solve(also read the speaker notes) 
•	See also how to use Jupyter notebooks here: https://app.pluralsight.com/guides/jupyter-notebook-getting-started


## 💻 Exercise

In this exercise you will execute a pre-set jupyter notebook with code and exercises to learn the machine learning training process using the MNIST dataset for handwritten digits recognition.

### 🧰 Prerequisites

Basic understanding of AI, for instance you attended “What problems does AI solve”. Or you have seen the following Pluralsight course: Understanding Machine Learning https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/understanding-machine-learning/table-of-contents 

#### 🚇 Infrastructure

You can run this on binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aso000/dcom23.git/HEAD?labpath=dcom23challenge.ipynb)

### 🚀 Getting Started

Now that the challenge notebook is loaded you can follow the steps described there to learn and understand how a model can predict house prices based on a toy dataset

After completing, save and download your notebook. The environment will not persist your data or results and the content will be automatically deleted.


## 🙌 Congratulations! Submit your solution.
Submit your predictions using your improved model to your instructor. She/He will tell you how you rank.
